    <h1>More About Me</h1>

    <p>My name is <strong>Sandile Thabede</strong>, and I am a dedicated and passionate individual from <strong>Mandlazini, Richards Bay</strong>. I completed my National Senior Certificate in 2024 with strong results, especially in History, Math Literacy, and IsiZulu. Although I didn’t get into university, I chose to take charge of my future by pursuing short courses in technology and career development.</p>

    <h2>My Current Journey</h2>
    <p>I'm currently enrolled in the following programs:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>ALX Data Science Program</strong> (Started March 2025) – Learning Python, data analysis, machine learning, and real-world data projects.</li>
      <li><strong>FNB App Academy</strong> (Started May 2025) – Gaining hands-on experience in HTML, CSS, and app development fundamentals.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why Tech?</h2>
    <p>I chose the tech path because it offers a chance to solve real-world problems, impact people’s lives, and secure a future where I can support my family—especially my mother. My father works at Foskor, but I’ve seen how difficult things can get, which inspires me to work even harder and make better choices. I’ve also made the decision to avoid alcohol so I don’t follow negative patterns.</p>

    <h2>My Values</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Hard work and discipline</li>
      <li>Family first – especially building my mother a house</li>
      <li>Respect, focus, and personal growth</li>
      <li>Community impact – I want to be an example to other young people in Mandlazini</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>I love adventure-style games like <em>Silent Hill: Shattered Memories</em></li>
      <li>I’ve helped my brother by cooking and supporting him emotionally</li>
      <li>I enjoy using my midnight data to study tech and improve myself</li>
    </ul>
